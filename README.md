# PlayStation Network PKG Torrents
For people that have unstable internet.

Can be paused because it is a torrent.

Webseeded by Sony servers.

Utilizes the power of peer to peer downloads and the client-server downloads.

Combines the best of both worlds (P2P and Direct HTTP Link).

## Technical Infos
All game links that I used for creating the torrent are from [NoPayStation](https://nopaystation.com/).

All torrents that I created are created on qbittorrent.

All torrents that I created are created on Google Compute Engine VPS.

The piece size of the torrent that I creared are set automatically by libtorrent.

~~When a torrent is created, all trackers are taken on [newTrackon](https://newtrackon.com/) trackerlist at the time of the creation.~~
As of 5/31/19, we are going trackerless, relying on Distributed Hash Table and Peer EXchange, to help reduce the burden of the torrent trackers.

## Contributing
All torrents are created if I need/want to download that game, so not all games are included.

If you need a game not included in this repository, just make an issue.
