# PlayStation Network PKG Torrents
For people that have unstable internet.

Can be paused because it is a torrent.

Webseeded by Sony servers.

Utilizes the power of peer to peer downloads and the client-server downloads.

Combines the best of both worlds (P2P and Direct HTTP Link).

## Technical Infos
All game links that I used for creating the torrent are from [NoPayStation](https://nopaystation.com/).

Our torrents are trackerless, relying on Distributed Hash Table and Peer EXchange, to help reduce the burden of torrent trackers.

## Torrent Webseed Creator
Using GitHub Actions to download game PKG, and using [torrenttools](https://github.com/fbdtemme/torrenttools) to create a torrent file for that game.

On [torrent-creator](https://github.com/AnimMouse/psn-pkg-torrents/tree/torrent-creator) branch.

## Contributing
Game torrents are created if I need/want to download that game, so not all games are included.

If you need a game not included in this repository, just make an issue.
