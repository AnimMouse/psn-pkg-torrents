# PlayStation Network PKG Torrents
For people that have slow and/or unstable internet.

Can be paused because it is a torrent.

Webseeded by Sony servers.

Utilizes the power of peer to peer downloads and the client-server downloads.

Combines the best of both worlds (P2P and Direct HTTP Link).

## Technical Infos
All game links that I used for creating the torrent are from [NoPayStation](https://nopaystation.com/).

Our torrents are trackerless, relying on Distributed Hash Table and Peer EXchange, to help reduce the burden of torrent trackers.

## Torrent Webseed Creator
Powered by [Torrent Webseed Creator](https://github.com/AnimMouse/torrent-webseed-creator), a webseeded torrent creator using GitHub Actions.

Using GitHub Actions to download game PKG.

Powered by [torrenttools](https://github.com/fbdtemme/torrenttools) to create a torrent file for that PKG.

## Game Requests
Game torrents are created if I need/want to download that game, so not all games are included.

If you need a game not included in this repository, comment on the [Game Requests discussion](https://github.com/AnimMouse/psn-pkg-torrents/discussions/8) on GitHub.

For games not downloading on torrents or for any problems, make an issue on GitHub.

If you don't have a GitHub Account, you can join on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MafyWwVek6) or email your requests at psn-pkg-torrents@animmouse.com
